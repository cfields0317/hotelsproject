The typical reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost which is beneficial to hotel guests but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with. Such losses are particularly high on last-minute cancellations.\n","\n","The new technologies involving online booking channels have dramatically changed customers’ booking possibilities and behavior. This adds a further dimension to the challenge of how hotels handle cancellations, which are no longer limited to traditional booking and guest characteristics.\n","\n","The cancellation of bookings impact a hotel on various fronts:\n","* Loss of resources (revenue) when the hotel cannot resell the room.\n","* Additional costs of distribution channels by increasing commissions or paying for publicity to help sell these rooms.\n","* Lowering prices last minute, so the hotel can resell a room, resulting in reducing the profit margin.\n","* Human resources to make arrangements for the guests.\n","\n","## Objective\n","The increasing number of cancellations calls for a Machine Learning based solution that can help in predicting which booking is likely to be canceled. INN Hotels Group has a chain of hotels in Portugal, they are facing problems with the high number of booking cancellations and have reached out to your firm for data-driven solutions. You as a data scientist have to analyze the data provided to find which factors have a high influence on booking cancellations, build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.\n","\n","## Data Description\n","The data contains the different attributes of customers' booking details.

Consider implementing dynamic pricing strategies during peak seasons to maximize revenue while offering discounts during off-peak periods to attract more guests.\n","* Given that most guests come from online bookings, invest in improving your online booking platform. Enhance the user experience, offer flexible cancellation policies, and provide incentives for direct bookings through your website.\n","* Analyze the wide range of prices for online and offline bookings. Consider implementing a more structured pricing strategy for these channels. For aviation bookings with fixed prices, explore partnerships or special offers to attract more guests.\n","* The overall cancellation rate is 32.8%, which is relatively high. Investigate the reasons behind cancellations and categorize them. Identify common patterns and tailor your cancellation policies accordingly. Prioritizing customer feedback for cancellations would help.\n","* Encourage repeat guests by offering loyalty programs and incentives that reduce the likelihood of cancellations. Provide benefits such as room upgrades, discounts, or exclusive offers for returning customers.\n","* Acknowledge the inverse relationship between the number of special requests and the cancellation rate. Encourage guests to make special requests, as this seems to make them less likely to cancel. This could be due to increased engagement and commitment to their stay.\n","* Given that lead time has the highest relevance importance and longer lead times correlate to higher cancelations, implimenting a higher cancelation fee should help.\n","* Market segment type is another crucial factor. Tailor your marketing and promotional strategies to different market segments. For example, create targeted campaigns for corporate bookings or aviation bookings to increase loyalty and reduce cancellations.\n","* Review and refine your refund and cancellation policies to strike a balance between guest satisfaction and revenue protection. Consider flexible cancellation options for guests with valid reasons.\n","* Continue to analyze guest data and booking trends to make informed decisions. Monitor the performance of implemented strategies and adjust them as needed. Continue to utilize data scientist to build machine learning models to aid in predicting future trends and projections."],"metadata":{"id":"aGaTwL_T08CI"},"id":"aGaTwL_T08CI"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from nbconvert import HTMLExporter\n","import nbformat\n","\n","# Load the Colab notebook\n","notebook_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Fields_Project_4_NNHotels_FullCode.ipynb'  # Replace with your notebook's path\n","notebook = nbformat.read(notebook_path, as_version=4)\n","\n","# Create an HTMLExporter instance\n","html_exporter = HTMLExporter()\n","\n","# Convert the notebook to HTML\n","(html, _) = html_exporter.from_notebook_node(notebook)\n","\n","# Save the HTML to a file\n","output_file_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Google Drive/Documents/Personal/School/UT/UT Post Grad McCombs/Project 3/Fields_Project_4_NNHotels_FullCode.html'  # Replace with your desired output path\n","with open(output_file_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n","    f.write(html)"],"metadata":{"id":"hxRY14HK03Gm","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1705790289560,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":1646,"user":{"displayName":"Carter Fields","userId":"15552976658223602826"}}},"id":"hxRY14HK03Gm","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"id":"SJJWOjTj26er","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1705790289560,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":1645,"user":{"displayName":"Carter Fields","userId":"15552976658223602826"}}},"id":"SJJWOjTj26er","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"collapsed_sections":["xxhpZv9y-qTw","desperate-infection","r8omfzv0tHOz","dEuSu6e4hU2e","mwAu-vEwhU2m","7E1orwlJhU20","Ie6gSJh8hU28","seasonal-calibration","-VHCTLmzEl8C","vXoQOPsVhU3h","wuL-aB65tHO_","rsaxyjL7tHO_","QkXGt6lVtHPA","IQ59IaDXtHPB","UbZDB3TGtHPq","Lw6uFMRutHPr","8n3SWYNWtufM","nfBipAuNum2n","vgoKC44yuv_i","PWHKc8McuwuJ","gD-_o9BouyV3","NKryEr8Ku0KN","8lS2qTUsu06u","muVDirrnu8Ub","alleged-spirituality","cultural-engagement","d8XDDQvitHPy","SRz5Aks1tHPy","WGn7w06uxLQP","WUfIDKYkJHqv","QMt62ns9tHP0","TbY1Lz1otHP1","2YgsRY9ktHP2","guc7EuIJxLQ-","62dQ0wu5xLRL","rW3G9W8PtHP6","JLZDokvTtHP7","UvvLsO1qtHP7","qzHfpcXUtHP9","third-projection","stylish-collaboration","nasty-retailer"],"provenance":[{"file_id":"1Y7aNF0erogEkn6OGHENn-XIEA-U5Bf1-","timestamp":1702339059310}]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.8"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
